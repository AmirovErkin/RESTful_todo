## Usage

In this program, you can perform various actions using different HTTP methods on the `/api/` endpoint:

- **GET** `/api/`: Retrieve all items.
- **POST** `/api/new`: Add a new item.
- **PUT** `/api/id/update/`: Update an item with the specified ID.
- **DETAIL** `/api/id`: Partially update an item with the specified ID.
- **DELETE** `/api/id/delete`: Delete an item with the specified ID.

Depending on the type of request, different functions will be activated to handle the corresponding action.
